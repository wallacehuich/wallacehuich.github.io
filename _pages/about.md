I am a computational geochemist interested in the physical chemistry of aqueous fluids at the molecular scale. My research utilizes DFT-based <em>ab initio</em> molecular dynamics, classical simulations, and advanced quantum chemistry methods (e.g., MP2, CCSD(T)) to explore how metals (e.g. gold) and volatile species (e.g. sulfur dioxide) interact with water across a wide range of temperatures and pressures. I probe water solvent environment ranging from nano-hydration (involving <10 water molecules), to the dynamic surface and interior environments of nanodroplets (~100–1000 molecules), and to conventional bulk liquids and vapors. By performing detailed quantum chemical calculations of molecular structures, binding energies, vibrational signatures, and reaction free energies, my work ultimately aims to push our understanding of aqueous systems in natural environments.

Recently, my research has ventured into the fascinating topic of water nanodroplets, revealing how droplet surface and interior create unique solvation environments — with distinct variations in density, pH, dielectric properties, and more. These differences profoundly impact chemical speciation behaviours and metal complexation strengths. Explore this site for highlights of my research, publications, and the innovative projects!
